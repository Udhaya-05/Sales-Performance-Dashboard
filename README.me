# 📊 Sales Performance Analysis & Insights Dashboard

A business intelligence dashboard built in Power BI to analyze sales trends, revenue patterns, and anomalies using retail transaction data from 2010–2011.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Thursday alone contributed **22%** of weekly revenue, informing optimal promotion timing.
- Detected high-revenue B2B-like orders making up **5% of invoices** but generating **18%** of total revenue.
- Enabled country-wise revenue analysis and weekday performance tracking to guide marketing and logistics.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (DAX, KPIs, visuals)
- **MySQL** (data cleaning, joins, export)
- **Excel** (initial preprocessing)
- **Retail sales data** (500K+ records)

## 🧼 Preprocessing Summary

Before importing into MySQL, the dataset was cleaned in Excel:

- Converted `InvoiceDate` format from `DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM` to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
- Replaced formula-based transformations with pasted values
- Allowed blank `CustomerID` to remain NULL for relational consistency
- Optionally reduced dataset size during testing (10K–50K rows)
